We identi ied the problem of misdirected appointments in healthcare and proposed 
building a Medical Chatbot for Symptom Analysis that guides patients to the appropriate 
specialist. 
Objectives: 
 
 
 
Understand patient-described symptoms via conversation. 
Map symptoms to the correct medical department (e.g., Cardiology, Dermatology). 
Reduce unnecessary or misdirected specialist visits. 
We submitted a detailed proposal de ining the problem, objectives, required tools (IBM 
Watson Assistant, watsonx.ai), and expected outcomes.
